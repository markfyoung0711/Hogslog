## Displaying Movements on GIS Maps

Incorporating animal movement data into GIS maps allows for visual tracking and analysis of various species' movements. This data can highlight patterns based on size and species.

### Directions of Travel
By utilizing graphical representations, the direction of travel can be easily visualized. Arrows or lines can indicate movement trajectories, enhancing understanding of habitat usage and navigation behavior.

### Implementation Steps
1. **Collect Movement Data**: Gather data from tracking devices or studies.
2. **GIS Software**: Use GIS software to import and analyze movement data.
3. **Visual Representation**: Choose appropriate symbols and colors to represent different species or sizes. 
4. **Interpretation**: Analyze the visual data for patterns and insights related to habitat preferences or migration paths.
