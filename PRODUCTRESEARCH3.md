# Additional Features in Addition to DeerLab Features

## Real-Time Tracking of Movements
One of the standout features that enhances the capabilities of DeerLab is the real-time tracking of movements between cameras. This functionality allows users to efficiently monitor animal activities across various regions by linking visual data from multiple camera feeds.

### Defined Regions
Users can define specific regions within the camera coverage area. This means that when an animal moves between these regions, the system is able to track its path, providing insights into its behavior, habits, and patterns. This data can be pivotal for researchers and wildlife enthusiasts, enabling more effective studies and conservation efforts.

### Benefits of Real-Time Tracking
- **Enhanced Monitoring**: Continuous updates on wildlife movement.
- **Behavioral Insights**: Understanding how animals interact with different terrains.
- **Efficient Resource Management**: Identifying areas of high animal activity can help in planning further research or resource allocation.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple tools to define and adjust regions as needed, ensuring flexibility and ease of use for real-time monitoring.
